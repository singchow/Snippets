Hi, Shiung here!
Testing out the GitHub Synch thingy.

Meeting access denied errors from the direct clone, hence I'm forking it to my repository to try out pull requests!

Added in the WIP branch.
Mistakenly committed the first commit to Masters.

Sent a Pull Request.

Testing out synchronizing with an update remote "Original" repository.

Testing out synchronizing updates of the "Original" remote repository to the "Personal" remote repository before getting it down to the "Local" repository.
Seems like the addition of "git remote add <name> <remote_repository_url>" is required to be done locally, pushed remotely, and synched remotely before doing it locally.

Things to be added:
1. "git remote -v" to check current branches available of the local directory (file).
2. "git remote add <name> <original_remote_repository_URL>" if required. Meaning that only one remote repository listed.
3. "git fetch <original_remote_repository_NAME>" based on the names listed by "git remote -v" to synchronize the branch.
4. "git merge <name/branch> <personal_wip_branch>" to merge changes of the "Original" repository branch to the local directory(file).
5. "git status" to checkout the changes, "git branch" to ensure you're on the right branch, and "git push" to update the personal remote GitHub branch.
6. Test if everything works. Operation validation step.
7. "git checkout master" switch to master branch on personal repository.
8. "git merge <personal_wip_branch> master" to merge the altered branch to the local master branch.
9. "git checkout <personal_wip_branch>" to move back to WIP branch.

OPTIONAL - Used only if the branch synched in was not to the WIP branch (had something working here). After step 8.
1. "git branch -d <branch>" to delete the remote branch as clean up.
2. "git checkout -b <new_personal_wip_branch>" to make a new branch. OR
3. "git checkout <personal_wip_branch>"

Creation of Snippet scaffold.
Removed comments of routes.rb.

Scaffolded data columns:
  snippet_id            auto-gen integer
  snippet_title         string
  snippet_description   text
  snippet_content       text
  snippet_view_count    integer auto-increase

Foreign key insertion:
  snippet_creator       user_id

For Favorite table:
  favorite_id     auto-generated
  user_id         user_id
  snippet_id      snippet_id

Obstacles:
  Formatting of index page for main Snippets view.
  Database association
  Database manipulation
  Foreign key insertion
  Data extraction from Database

Solution:
  Checking out tutorial for making a blog with RoR.
